  <h2>Staging</h2>
  <h3>The Browser as a Stage</h3>
  <p>Think of the different pieces of animation as happening on stages... in the DOM!</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="slide">For multipart animations, different scenes of the animation can occupy different layers.</li>
    <li class="slide">You'll rely heavily on <code>position</code> for the props and actors.</li>
    <li class="slide">And on <code>opacity</code> for showing and hiding the scene.</li>
  </ul>
