    <ul>
        <li class="slide"><strong>It's familiar.</strong> You have and know these tools already.</li>
        <!--NOTE: I wanted to make cartoons since when?-->
        <li class="slide"><strong>It's efficient.</strong> Using CSS to animate instead of JS saves energy.</li>
        <li class="slide"><strong>It's the future.</strong> Playing with advanced techniques brings a deeper understanding.</li>
        <li class="slide"><strong>It's fun.</strong> Isn't that enough?</li>
        <li class="slide"><strong>Content != copy.</strong> CSS can be used to tell visual stories, not just set line-heights.</li>
    </ul>
