  <h2>Play State</h2>
  <h3>The Playing States</h3>
  <p>This is one of the few reasons to use JavaScript with your animation.</p>
  <p>These are the mandatory play states to handle asset loading:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Loading</strong> JS, CSS, music and images are still being downloaded.</li>
    <li><strong>Loaded</strong> They are all downloaded. We are go for play.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="slide">
    <h3>Optional Play States</h3>
    <p>Because complex interactions have complex needs.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="slide"><strong>Playing</strong> User has indicated to begin the animation.</li>
      <li class="slide"><strong>Paused</strong> If you allow playback control or need to pause while the tab is out of focus.</li>
      <li class="slide"><strong>Error</strong> Good if you have a backup plan!</li>
      <li class="slide"><strong>Finished</strong> To kick off something after the animation.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
